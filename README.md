# Simple Brochure Site

This is a modest repository which provides the code for my upcoming Codeception course for 
PluralSight. The intent of the repository isn't to provide a wonderful, beautifully designed 
application, one that can either infinitely scale, or be something which you'd put on your resume, 
or anything like that. 

It's simply tasked with providing enough functionality so that it can 
support the Codeception course, such that if you're taking the course, you can follow along, and 
see ahead of time the concepts and techniques which are taught throughout the course.

## Getting Started

Once you've cloned the repository, you can run it in one of three ways; you can use Composer, 
Docker, or Vagrant.
 
### Composer

To launch the application using Composer, run the command below. 

```bash
$ composer serve
```

### Docker

To launch the application using Docker, run the command below. 

```bash
$ composer start-docker-container
```

### Vagrant

To launch the application using Vagrant, run the command below. 

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

You can then browse to <http://localhost:8080>.
